        <h1>High School Robotics.</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            From my sophomore to senior year at Muchin College Prep High School, I participated in the Robotics Club. 
            The Robotics Club focused on underwater robotics competitions. 
            As one of the founding members of the club, I held the position of Project Manager in which my responsibilities were to create the required documentations, provide tasks to other team members, and ensure we were prepared for competitions.
