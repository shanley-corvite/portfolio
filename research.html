        <h1>Research.</h1>
        <p> When I entered college, I learned that a major passion of mine is research. 
            I’ve been blessed with numerous opportunities that have allowed me to explore research in different fields. 
            I work closely with projects inside and outside of the University of Michigan where I investigate the following research areas:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            social media, human-computer interaction (HCI), user-experience design (UXD), emotional health and wellbeing, life transitions, representation

            <h2>Life Transitions and Social Technologies</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                At the University of Michigan's School of Information, I work closely with Assistant Professor, Dr. Oliver L. Haimson and other students on the Life Transitions and Social Technologies project.
                This project focuses on various life transitions and how social technologies help people facilitate those experiences of major change.

            <h2>Exploring the Perceptions of Race on Video Game Covers</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                During the Summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to join the iSchool Inclusion Institute (i3), a program that gives students research and leadership development experience. 
                i3 prepares students from underrepresented populations for graduate study and careers in the information sciences. 
                I work closely with Ph.D Candidate Daniel L. Gardner from University of California-Irvine along with other students from all over the world. 
                We focus on what representations of race are currently on video game covers, how they are perceived by potential players, and what the implications of these perceptions are.
